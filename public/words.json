Thai people frequently wai towards a Buddha image when passing by one, sometimes even while driving! If there's a perceived difference in status between two people perfoming the wai, then it is usually the junior or 'lower status' person who will wai first. For instance, a student will wai the teacher first, and not the other way around. The more senior will then usually 'wai' back (รับไหว้), although this is unnecessary in certain situations such as being 'wai-ed' to by children or cashiers. The higher the hands are raised and the deeper the bow, the greater the respect being shown to the recipient of the 'wai'.

Although they may still go out to seek alms during the day, they must return to sleep in their temple and aren't permitted to defrock during พรรษา. The tradition comes from early Buddhism in India, where holy men and sages would minimise travel during the rainy season to avoid accidentally killing young animals, insects or plants. Ordinary Buddhists also do their part by pledging to give up various vices during the พรรษา period, in much the same way as Christians during Lent. Being a monk during พรรษา is thought to bring great merit, and is an act that brings pride not only to the man himself but to his entire family. Many Thai males will ordain as monks for พรรษา before getting married, although some opt to ordain for shorter periods instead. The พรรษา period is marked with 2 large nationwide festivals - เข้าพรรษา which marks the start of พรรษา and commonly falls in July, and ออกพรรษา which marks the end of it and is usually in October."},{"word":"พระชนม์","transliteration":"prá chon","translation":"[N] (royal) age, life","translationAlt":""},{"word":"พระทัย","transliteration":"prá-tai","translation":"[N] (royal) heart, mind","translationAlt":"mind, heart"},{"word":"พระราชธิดา","transliteration":"prá râat-chá-tí-daa","translation":"[NC -
